grad who just joined the company\ncame up to me and he asked \"How can I become you?\"\nNow, needless to say, that's a pretty disturbing question.\nI thought my wife might have some issues with it.\nI wasn't exactly sure what it would mean to me personally when that occurred.\nBut I think what he really meant was, how can I get your job?\nAnd I'd be happy working\nfor this young fellow, he seemed pretty nice.\nSo he's really looking for career advice, he's looking for insights.\nI guess he was looking for wisdom.\nIn truth, despite my years of\ngoing through this journey,\nI have none of these\nthings to offer you today.\nI can offer my story, and let you derive whatever wisdom from it you can, so we'll get started.\nNow, unfortunately, my recollection of my past is quite hazy.\nBut I did do a little bit of research.\nYou're not, like, live blogging,\nor something there, are you?\nI did do some research,\nand uncovered a little bit\nof historical evidence.\nAnd so, let's start at the start."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How did I get here?\nWell, as best I can tell, it started\nabout 13.8 billion years ago.\nThere was an event, it\nwas called the Big Bang.\nApparently, stars formed,\ndecayed, exploded, and eventually,\non this planet, about 50,000 years ago,\nour species ventured forth out of Africa\nand into Western Europe.\nFrom there,\nabout 121 years ago, my\ngenetic material migrated\nand coalesced on this point.\nI began then a 40-year lifetime migration.\nThis is actually my life's migratory path.\nI know what you're\nsaying, wild, wild stuff!\nThis guy's been an adventurer.\nThat's right.\nAnd, in fact, how did I get here?\nIn truth, it wasn't a 90\nminute drive this morning.\nLike an aged salmon heading upstream,\nI rode\nup through the river\nof my life up to here.\nPresumably, this afternoon\nI will come here,\nI'm here to pass on to the\nnext generation, and then,\nI guess, that presumably I'll\nfind my way back further east\nand it'll all end for me there.\nA few more details that might add\na little color to my story.\nLet's start at the start,\nthis is allegedly me.\nI was born in San Leandro many, you know,\nit's pretty close, just\nacross, just down 580.\nWhen I was 10 years old, I\ngot a cool shirt, for one.\nMy interest back then, I\nwas really into skiing.\nI also was into basketball.\nIn fact, I was pretty\nsure I was gonna be Dr. J.\nHe was my idol, and I\nwas gonna join the NBA.\nNow, it did not work out.\nWhat did happen, is there\nwas an afterschool program,\nand my mom said, \"Hey, son,\nmaybe the NBA is not gonna be\n\"your thing, you should\ndo this computer class.\n\"There are these things called computers,\n\"and they're bringing some\nApple IIs around after school,\n\"you should do that.\"\nAnd I said, "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\"Mom, only posers are into computers.\""}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nJust people who want to seem cool,\nthey go and they do the computer thing.\nBut, I went, and,\nit was\na mind-blowing event.\nIn fact,\nthere were several hours of\nlike trying to draw pictures by,\nyou know, plotting lines,\nand I thought, this is dumb.\nBut, then, there was a\nmoment at the very end where\nthey had us write this program.\nHow old are you?\nInput A.\nPrint \"In 10 years you will be\"; A+10.\nAnd my mind exploded!\nI mean, it was, that\nwas it, I was like this,\nI know exactly the future now.\nAnd I am gonna be part of\nit, it's all about computers.\nI kid you not.\nI started, I'd had a little\nnugget of life savings.\nIt wasn't enough to buy a computer,\nso I started doing\nhousework, and doing weeding,\nand I was doing all these chores,\nbecause I was gonna buy a computer.\nAnd, eventually, I did, I\nbought a TRS-80 Color Computer.\nLook it up, 6809 processor, decent thing.\nI couldn't afford an Apple at the time.\nBut, I worked, I got\njobs, did little odd jobs\ndoing programming after I\ntaught myself some things.\nEventually, I was able to afford an Apple.\nAnd then, finally, in\n1984, the Mac came out,\nand I was able to\nexperience the Mac.\nAnd it was at that moment,\nbringing together, really,\nthe humanities and computer\nscience in this way\nthat previously I couldn't fully imagine\nthat it all really connected for me.\nAnd I decided at that time that someday\nI would work for Apple.\nI think I was in junior high at the time.\nAfter this,\nI went to Berkeley.\nSo that was awesome, I\nbrought another Mac with me.\nEventually, there were more Macs.\nAnd then,\nin 1988, I think it was,\nSteve Jobs had since left\nApple, and he had introduced\nthe NeXT machine in San Francisco.\nAnd he came to Berkeley,\nto kind of give a reperformance\nof the launch of the Mac.\nThere was no YouTube then,\nI wasn't gonna be able\nto see that launch online.\nBut he came to the PSL,\nand he kind of redid\nthe whole launch of the product,\nand showed off the NeXTcube.\nFor me, this was just\nan absolute revelation,\nI thought it was just incredible.\nAnd so, I decided, no, I'm\nnot gonna work for Apple,\nI'm gonna work for NeXT.\nSo that was my future.\nIn the meantime, coming to Berkeley,\nof course, I had to fit in.\nSo I got an electric guitar,\nthat was totally key.\nThat's really the only\nexplanation for this!\nBecause, now, why?\nSo the bandanna was actually\nnecessary for studying,\nto keep my hair out of my eyes.\nIf we pan down, you'd see, actually,\nthe circuit board, where\nin CS150 we were building\na digital answering machine,\nwith all these wires\nconnecting it, and that's\nwhat I was working on,\napparently, with my sunglasses on.\nTotally unclear.\nJust for posterity, here's my senior year\nBerkeley dining card.\nSo that was good stuff.\nI was a very, generally, a pretty shy,\nsocially awkward person, so\nthis whole look was pretty key,\nbecause, I could walk down the street\nand people would just\nclear to the other side.\nWhich says something to Berkeley, right,\nthat people were like, I\ndon't want to be anywhere near\nwhatever craziness is going on there.\nSo I was at Berkeley, it was\na fantastic educational experience for me.\nAfter being so into\ncomputers, and programming\nfrom really age 10 on,\nwhen I got to Berkeley,\nit was like, this is\neverything I want to know.\nEvery class I was like, I\nwant to learn more about that,\nI want to learn more about\nthat, so incredibly exciting.\nAnd not just the computer science classes.\nI mean, taking philosophy classes,\nand political science\nclasses, and business classes,\nI mean, all of this was just\nincredibly eye-opening for me.\nWhen I wrapped up, you know, most students\ntheir senior year were thinking,\nwhat are they gonna do with themselves?\nI had completely neglected\nto keep track of the fact\nthat I was about to\ngraduate and needed a job.\nAnd, fortunately, there\nwas a company there was\nan incredibly aggressive recruiter.\nAnd since I'd done nothing\nto try to seek a job,\nI accepted their offer,\nand headed down to Oracle.\nBut, the key for me was,\nthroughout my late high school\nand college years, I\nthought the next thing\nI'm gonna do after I graduate,\nis a gotta spend a winter skiing.\nI headed out west to\nColorado and spent the winter\ndoing this kind of stuff.\nBut, the key was, I brought\nmy NeXT computer with me\nand actually worked remotely\nfrom a little cabin.\nIt was like a little ski monk thing,\nyou'd ski in the morning,\nand then come back\nand code in the afternoon.\nBut, interestingly, I\ndid some of the most,\nI guess, kind of inventive work\nat the time, in my time,\nin this weird, this weird environment.\nSo sometimes inspiration\ncomes in strange places.\nI headed back, and ended up\ncoming up back to Berkeley\nfor graduate school, in '92, to\nseek a Master's.\nI brought my NeXT computer with me.\nI did all my classes there, and just,\nthrough a modem uploaded all\nmy stuff to the school systems.\nGrad school was great.\nBut after that, I was actually\nable to fulfill my goal,\nand got to join NeXT.\nAnd then a strange thing\nhappened, because, you know,\nI was young, I thought I'd be at Apple,\nbut then I decided I wanted to be at NeXT.\nAnd then I show up at NeXT,\nand then we get acquired by Apple.\nBack at Apple again.\nBut this was a fantastic period for me.\nThere were so many different\nproblems to work on\nand, you know, a lot of things\nI didn't anticipate working\non, I got to learn about.\nAnd some of that led to\nsomething called\nWebObjects, it was like a,\nreally, a declarative user interface\nkind of environment for\nbuilding web services.\nI did that for awhile.\nBut, then, the whole B2B, eCommerce,\nyou all know about the dotcom crash.\nBefore that happened, there\nwas the dotcom bubble,\nand I got to participate in that.\nI worked for a company called Ariba.\nBy then, I was a management\ntype, I guess, or partly.\nDid a lot of coding, but, my job was CTO.\nNow, this is a good\ngig, if you can get it.\nIt was...\nI did platform architecture,\nkind of UI and App design,\nproduct strategy, I was\nsort of the demo guy.\nSo this, this was good times.\nBut, most importantly, in\nthis period of my life,\nI defied all expectations\nand met a woman.\nMy wife!\nWho agreed to marry me.\nSo this was fantastic!\nStrangely,\nafter that, this thing\nstarted to happen where\nthese kids started to show up.\nWe never quite figured out\nwhy this was happening.\nBut, eventually, it did stop\nafter we made four of\nthem, so, there's that.\nAnd it became a little\nbit overwhelming, and so,\nafter having done a little bit of the CTO\nkind of semi-executive\nthing, I actually decided\nto take a couple years and return to being\na individual contributor engineer,\nand did a bunch of open source stuff.\nIf you go to AribaWeb.org,\nyou can probably still see\nthe website I left\nthere over a decade ago.\nBut that, that engineering\nwriting code is still,\nyou know, kind of my favorite\nthing to do in my spare time,\nand it felt great to return to doing that.\nBut after that period, I returned to,\nor, yeah, finally came back to Apple.\nIt was really kind of home for me,\nand, apparently, I'm gonna die there.\nI started with, started with MacOS,\nand then went on to, to do iOS, as well.\nAnd it's been an incredible opportunity\nand journey for me there.\nSo what can we learn from all of this?\nA few possible lessons.\nOne that's very clear is don't move!\nWherever you're born, stay\nthere and wait for the industry\nthat you need to erupt right around you.\nAnd then just seek employment there.\nThe second lesson, heavy metal!\nI mean, it's very clear that that is\na key element of growth.\nAnd neglect looking for a job.\nIf any of you were planning\non looking for a job,\nset that aside.\nSki, very important.\nAnd also, pick one haircut in the 80s\nand just stick with it.\nThat was just, it was absolutely,\nI haven't changed my instructions\nto the barber ever since.\nSo, seriously, there are\na few things I'd observe.\nI don't know if these are\nimportant, or essential,\nbut they are some things that I think\nseem to be important to me.\nHow can I get your job?\nWell, in truth, the key part is, first,\nwe'll go with seven easy steps,\nfirst step is don't want my job.\nI didn't want my job.\nYou know, maybe you shouldn't either.\nI think the most important thing to do,\nis to focus on doing what you love.\nIf you're worried about\nwhere you're going,\nwhere this all will take\nyou, if you're too focused on\nthe destination, I think\nyou'll miss the journey.\nWhen you do what you love,\nit turns out that the things\nyou do in your spare time,\nlike on my time, if I have\na moment on the weekend,\nI'm gonna be reading\nthings about programming,\nI'm gonna be reading\nthings about software,\nor artificial intelligence,\nbecause that's what I love!\nSo it's like, if you\ndo something you love,\nit's like cheating, because, all of your,\nyour recreational time\nactually turns into time\nthat helps you develop in your career.\nThat part is super-important.\nSecond, work with people\nwhose work you admire.\nI think the thing about me\nbeing drawn to NeXT, was I saw\nthis product back in\n'88, that I said this is,\nit just spoke to me, this is\nan incredible piece of work.\nI need to be, I need to see\nwhat it's like to be among\nthe people who can do that kind of thing.\nAnd so, I just, I felt magnetically drawn\nto be among the people\nwho did this kind of work\nthat I really appreciated,\nand to learn from them.\nAnd that gets me to number\nthree, which is pay attention.\nIt's amazing, in life,\none of my kids, actually,\nsaid to me the other day, they said,\n\"You know, I figured out a secret.\n\"Like, in class,\n\"pay attention.\"\nI thought, wow!\nBecause, they're like, \"All the other kids\n\"are not paying any attention.\n\"And we have to sit there anyway.\n\"Imagine how much you could\nlearn, if you paid attention.\"\nDuring life, I mean, you are,\nthrough your working life,\nthrough your school\nlife, you're surrounded\nwith all of these opportunities to learn.\nAnd not just in your field,\nnot just in the thing\nthat you think you're\nstudying, but all those things\nperipheral to the field you're studying.\nThere's so many fascinating\nthings to learn.\nAnd, for me, I carried around\na notebook paper and a pencil,\nand was just taking notes all the time.\nPeople thought I was like\na wandering reporter,\nor spy, or something, because I was just\nconstantly jotting things down.\nBecause there's just so\nmany interesting things.\nAnd if you're making use of the time\nto suck 'em all in, if you're curious,\nit really helps.\nNumber four, and this is kind of related,\nnever stop acting like\nthe new one on the team.\nWhen you first join a team...\nFor those of you have done\ninternships, you know,\nyou get to have that moment\nwhen you first get a job,\nyou show up and no one\nexpects you to know anything.\nAnd so, you get to ask\nthe stupid questions.\nYou get to say, oh, I don't\nknow anything about that.\nCan you tell me about\nthat, why did we do that?\nI've never stopped being that person.\nThat's such a valuable moment to say,\nit's okay if I don't know everything.\nI can have questions.\nAnd, if you do, it turns\nout, some of those questions\nare questions that team probably should\nhave been asking themselves, and wasn't.\nAnd so, if you're asking,\nyou might get some answers\nthat everybody needs to hear.\nBut, also, it's that\npermission to just be learning,\nand learning, and learning.\nBecause, it's not just about\nbeing narrow and being,\nwanting to be secure in one little area,\nevery adjacency is an area to explore.\nAnd the way you're gonna\nbroaden yourself and learn,\nis to just feel the permission\nto ask the questions all along the way.\nAnother thing is, I say it, you know, team\nare more important than self.\nWhen I've joined projects,\nI've decided that whatever\nthe team's mission is,\nwhatever we're trying to accomplish,\nI want to be part of making that happen.\nAnd I want to do\neverything that can be done\nto make that happen.\nIf it's, we're gonna go work,\nyou know, there's a point,\nI joined a team, and\nall, they were in a part\nof the release where it\nwas all about bug fixing.\nAll I was gonna do for year was fix bugs,\nso it didn't sound like\nthe coolest thing to do.\nIt turned out to be an\nincredible learning opportunity.\nThere was a part we had\nto work on performance.\nWell, I got to learn about\nperformance, because we had\nto fix the performance of\nthe thing I was working on.\nIf you become part of, adopt\nthe mission of the team,\nadopt that project, you find that there's\nso many different ways you can help.\nAnd, along the way, so many\ndifferent ways you can learn.\nWhere, if you're focused more about\nwhat does this mean for me,\nwhat am I interested in,\nI think you miss out on\nall of those opportunities.\nAnd I think related to this is this notion\nof committing for a period of time.\nI guess, I always looked at\nmy career as I'm gonna spend\nfour or five years I'm gonna do this,\nI'm not gonna wake up\neach morning and say,\nam I doing the right thing?\nShould I take a turn here, is this my path\nto where I want to be?\nInstead, I said, this what I'm gonna do,\nand my focus is just immersing\nmyself in that thing.\nBecause, it'd be like if you got married,\nand every day you woke up and you said,\nam I married to the right person?\nLike that would not be a\ngood relationship, right?\nTo have that thought in your\nhead the whole time, super-bad.\nI do not have that thought in my head.\nThe same thing would happen\nat work, you see these people\nso worried about, angsty\nabout am I in the right job,\nam I heading in the right direction?\nAssess the situation, make a choice,\nall these choices are imperfect,\nand then commit for awhile.\nGive yourself the opportunity\nto really experience it,\nand then set yourself a\ndeadline, and say, in a year or\nfour years from now, I'm gonna\nstep up having,\nstep back from having done all this,\nand then assess what I want to do next.\nThat certainly has been important\nto me, both in my sanity,\nand in my ability to\nreally commit in a way\nthat I think allowed to me\nto learn, and do good work.\nNumber seven, follow your heart.\nCheezy, but, it's been\nsuper-important for me.\nThere have been numerous, and sort of\nthe most important\ndecisions I've had to make,\nI feel like I made the decision\nthat if you were analytical\nabout it, if you made...\nI had an important decision\nto make, and I asked my dad,\n\"I'm having trouble, do\nI take this job here,\n\"or do I go to grad school?\n\"Do I take this position\nhere, or do I go over here?\"\nWhen I went to NeXT, I took a big pay cut\nto join a failing company.\nIt didn't seem like too smart a move.\nBut, I felt, he said, my\ndad said, \"Make a list.\n\"Write down all the good\nand bad of this decision,\n\"this decision, add it\nall up, there you go.\"\nI made the list.\nI, obviously, shouldn't go work for NeXT.\nBut, when I thought of making the decision\non that side of the thing, I\njust got a feeling in my gut,\nlike, no, I want to be there.\nAnd it turned out there\nwas probably something,\nsomething wise or intuitive\nabout what was drawing me\nto the right decision.\nThe ability to listen to\nyourself in those moments,\nand make those decisions,\nI think, over and over\non the most important decisions,\nthat's been super-important.\nAnd then when you're there,\nyou feel good about it.\nAnd, of course, I say all of this,\nthis is one story, one data point.\nI mean, let's be honest,\nbe very, very lucky.\nHowever you figure that out,\nI haven't cracked the code,\nbut it seemed to happen for me.\nThat's a little advice.\nThank you, very much, and\nI think we're gonna do\nsome questions, and I'll sit down,\nand we'll see how it goes.\n(people applauding)\nThat's good, thank you.\n(people applauding)\nAll right, so I'll just start\nout with just a few questions,\nand I'll hand it over\nfor the students soon,\nin a little while.\nAll right, so that's a wonderful story.\nThank you, for taking us\nthrough your whole life journey.\nIt spanned many years and\nsome miles.\nVery, very little geography.\nThat's wonderful, but,\nyou know, it's clearly\nsome common themes were\nApple, that's amazing,\nyou know, starting when you were 10.\nAnd then Berkeley, right,\nthe connection there,\nyou know, Steve Wozniak is\nwhom you saw, heard?\nYes.\nAnd, you know, co-founder\nof Apple, but also,\none of our alums, so it's fantastic.\nI thought the advice was pretty good.\nWhat did you all think? (laughs)\nIt's not questionable.\nYes.\nThat's great.\nQuestions.\n(people applauding)\nYeah.\n(people applauding)\nI was just wondering, though,\nfrom your experience, what kind of,\nwhat are the important\nskills that you think are,\nyou know, critical for success?\nFirst of all, let's say as an engineer?\nBecause, our audience is primarily made\nof engineering students today.\nYeah, sure.\nYou know, it's an interesting\nblend today, because I think\non the one hand you want\nto be deep in a domain,\nhave real expertise, and that takes\na lot of hard work solving real problems,\nspending the time doing that.\nBut, I think, increasingly,\nand certainly in\nthe environment where I work now,\nsoftware engineering is\ncompletely a team sport.\nBuilding things at scale\nis about building things\nwith lots of people.\nAnd not just other software\nengineers building things with\ndesigners, working with project managers,\nworking with hardware\nteams, working, you know,\nall these other disciplines.\nAnd so, in addition to\nbeing an awesome engineer,\ncommunication is incredibly important.\nI mean, written communication,\nverbal communication.\nBeing able to collaborate\nis super-important.\nBeing able to\nempathize with users, if you're\nbuilding product software\nlike I do.\nCan you put yourself in the\nmindset of your customer,\nand think about how they're\ngonna see what you're doing,\nor what they want, what they value,\nand translate that?\nAnd then having the ability to,\nas part of collaboration, to respect all\nthese other disciplines.\nI'll say, when I was\nan undergrad, just super-focused\nprimarily on computer science,\nthere can be a tendency\nto see the world one way,\nthrough the eyes of\nsomeone who is, you know,\nvery analytical, and so forth,\nand to think that these other softer\nskills are, you know,\nnot strong.\nIn fact, what you come\nto appreciate, is that\nyou have a, you have many blind spots,\nthat that's a narrow point of view.\nAnd so, being able to\nrespect all of these different kinds\nof roles and points of view,\nand collaborate effectively\nwith those people,\nis what it takes to actually\ndo a great product as a team,\nand that's so much of what\nit's about these days.\nThat's my primary advice.\nOkay, that's fantastic, so, soft skills.\nYeah.\nAnd that's\nsomething which you demonstrate\nvery well here, I think.\nYou're as very comfortable\non the stage speaking,\ncommunicating effectively\nwith presentations, and just,\nyou know, extemporaneously.\nWere you like that when you were\n10 years old?\nAh, yeah.\nOr, even when you were\na college student?\nI don't know, it's,\nso, yes--\nHow did you develop\nthat skill?\nCertainly, it's been,\nthis has been the strangest\npart of my journey, is that,\nif any of you had ever\nheard of me before now,\nit's probably because, you\nknow, being on stage presenting\nsomething in front of\na big room of people.\nYou know, I grew up a very, I mean,\nI was like a pretty shy,\nsocially-awkward guy.\nCertainly, didn't get\ninto computer science\nfor the fame element of,\nof it, it's not kinda where you think\nit's your path to the\nstage, traditionally.\nAnd so, the fact things\nkinda went that way was\nquite surprising.\nI did, in high school,\nI actually was a DJ.\nWe had a radio station at my high school.\nWe used to call it a radio\nstation, we had an 8 watt,\nwe had a 10 watt transmitter,\nwhich had an eight mile range.\nBut, it was this opportunity for years\nto just talk, you know, talk\non the, talk on the air.\nSo I gotta think that actually\nplayed a role later on\nwith being comfortable\ncommunicating with people.\nBut that's, that's why I\nsay those things that you do\nthat don't seem like the\ncentral thing in your career.\nYou know, you have your\ndeep area of expertise,\nbut some of these other\nthings, they turn out\nto maybe play a role that you couldn't\nhave possibly anticipated.\nAnd certainly that worked out for me.\nAnd then, I also just found that\npresenting, I think a lot\nof people get caught up in,\nI gotta write out a script,\nI gotta memorize exactly\nwhat I'm gonna say.\nAnd then, that's too hard, I\ncould never succeed at that,\nmy memory wouldn't allow it.\nSo rather than do something really hard,\nI just figure if there's\nsomething I'm excited about,\nthat I want to share,\nI just try to get up there and be myself,\nand tell the story.\nAnd so, if you can get to a frame of mind\nwhere you know what\nyou want to get across,\nand you're willing to just\nput yourself out there,\nI think audiences appreciate\npeople who are just willing\nto be their authentic selves up there.\nRight, authentic, right.\nI found it really\ninteresting that you felt\nthat these soft skills\nare really important\nfor just an engineer, versus a leader.\nI think, clearly, as a\nmanager and a executive\nyou do need those kinds\nof communication skills,\nand empathy with, you\nknow, your customers.\nIt's great that you\nmentioned the ability to\nrespect and see people,\nsee different perspectives.\nJust, in general, I know when you\nand I spoke earlier this spring,\nwe talked about efforts\nhere at Berkeley to foster\na culture of inclusion in engineering,\nand to just ensure that\neverybody has a chance\nto thrive here, rather\nthan just to survive.\nYeah.\nHow do you think this diversity\nplays a role in tech, in the\ntech industry, specifically?\nWell, I mean, it's hugely important.\nAnd I know it's an area\nthat, of course, when we,\nwhen we look at some\nstatistics, it's an area where\nthe industry could do\nbetter, where we'd like,\nwhere we'd like to do much better.\nThat's an important\nproblem to solve, because,\nwhen you think about\nbuilding the best products,\nI think the best products come from,\ncome from diverse teams, fundamentally,\nthey come from\nunderstanding your customer.\nAnd your customer has, comes\nfrom all kinds of backgrounds,\nand experiences, and\ndesires, and aptitudes.\nIf the people in the room have a narrow perspective on what the customer wants, what the customer will understand,\nyou're gonna build something that's very narrow.\nI found over and over these areas where having  the right set of people in the room, it's eye-opening.\nYou go, of course, everyone would want this.\nAnd someone says, \"Actually, no.\"\nOr, \"Actually, this is, I\nreally value, value this.\"\nAnd you're like, \"Really?\"\nAnd you realize how narrow, sometimes, you can be viewing things\nif you just have a single viewpoint in the room.\nAnd, I mean, this has to do with both, you know, the culture, and what national customs, age,\nyou know, what's currently fashionable or popular with different demographics.\nI mean, you need this diversity along every dimension,\nwill inform you to build the right product.\nAnd it's not just understanding the customer.\nIt's also that the diversity of domain backgrounds,\nof ways of looking at the problem,\nare where you make those leaps, you know.\nWe can spend our time kind\nof optimizing in our lane.\nBut, where the really\ninteresting stuff happens,\nis when you cross the lanes.\nAnd that only happens by having\nthis diverse set of disciplines\ntogether at the table.\nIt's super-important, and\nwe need to do all we can.\nI know Berkeley's doing so\nmuch, to try to solve this.\nIt's super-important to doing good work.\nThat's great to hear.\nSo I know, it's wonderful\nthat you shared your story\nabout your family.\nAnd I know one of your\ndaughters is here today.\nLisa, welcome.\nShe's a little bigger now.\nYes.\nI'm wondering, have you\nfound it to be helpful\nto your career to be a parent?\nWell, first of all, a\nhusband and a parent,\nmaybe in that order? (laughs)\nI guess I have to say yes.\nWell, certainly, I bring\na certain perspective.\nYou know, there's\ncertain kinds of features\nthat suddenly seem much\nmore important to me\nthan they would if I was a single person,\nwhen it comes to thinking\nabout both what do kids want,\nwhat do families want.\nThere's also a element of just\nthe period of life, and\nbeing able to focus on work.\nYou know, work-life\nbalance is a challenge.\nWell, it's always, it's\nalways a challenge,\nand it may be especially a challenge\nwhen you start taking on family.\nAnd I have no good advice\nto offer you on that.\nI don't do that very well.\n(person laughing)\nBut, it's...\nI've certainly found that\nin today, often, and you\nknow, certainly, devices\nwe all carry in our pockets\nare part of this where\nit's easy to never be away from work.\nAnd you have to be, you\nhave to be away from work.\nNot only for the sake of\nbeing with your family.\nBut, also, that separation from that time\nwhere you can be intensely focused\non that environment to that\ntime that you let yourself\nbe unplugged from that.\nAnd so, if there's a piece\nof advice I can give you is,\nnumber one, sleep, give\nyourself time to sleep.\nI know I see all these\nT-shirts, there's one,\nwalking across the campus,\nsomeone had, eat, sleep, code,\nand then sleep was crossed out.\nLike, that...\nI just saw that like an hour ago.\nI'll say, I mean, it's sort of the legend\nhere at Berkeley, I think that, you know,\nyou can have sort of a\nsleep, or a social life,\nor grades, or something, you\nknow, pick two, pick any two.\nYes, actually, I think\nsome EECS students,\na number of years ago,\ndetermined, like, a relationship\nis worth like three units.\nIs that right?\nIs that what it costs?\nYeah, you can either take\na course for three units,\nor have a relationship.\nI was able to optimize\nthat part away completely.\nBut, I did, I did focus on the sleep part,\nand the school part.\nSo it's a huge part of deciding, I mean,\nat different points in\nyour life where are you,\nwhat are you gonna focus on,\nand what are you gonna give up?\nAnd it is certainly true,\nas you get into family,\nfamily becomes super-important.\nFor me, work was also really important,\nand, you know, a lot of other things you,\nyou focus out to a secondary place.\nSo do you encourage,\nlike, your team members,\nthe people who work for you to have,\nto achieve some kind of work-life balance?\nI mean, is that?\nYeah, and it's tricky, right?\nBecause, sometimes, I might be\nworking on a weekend, or something.\nAnd so, I uncover a\nquestion, and I'm thinking\nI'm gonna send an email just because it's\nMonday morning they can,\nyou know, go do this.\nBut then you say, you'd\nsend your question,\nand then do they feel obliged to,\noh, I just got this message,\nmaybe I should be working right now.\nI could probably do\nbetter to make clear that\nit's really when you're\nat work, you're at work,\nand when you're not at work,\nyou probably shouldn't be at work.\nThat's my advice.\nYes.\nActually, I learned from my students that\nthere's a feature, at least for Gmail,\nthat you can actually defer--\nDon't let any of the...\nYeah, so that people don't feel like\nthey have to respond to\nyou like after midnight,\nor over the weekend.\nDid it seem weird\nthat you just said that?\nAnd our students are great.\nAnd then you realize later, you didn't,\ncan you go back in the\noutbox, or remove it?\nIf you're like, no!\nIt's too late.\nIt doesn't make any sense.\nYeah, but now you have\nthe option to just delay the sending.\nOkay.\nThis is great, so I'd\nlike to open up the floor\nto questions from students.\nYeah, let me just--\nPreferably students.\nJust one thing.\nAnybody.\nLike I'm,\nI work, I work for Apple, but I'm here as,\nI'm just here as myself.\nI really, the questions\nI don't want to answer\nare things of the form.\nSure.\nWhat's the new iPhone?\niPhone 12.\nYes.\nOr why did Apple make this decision?\nOr, blah-blah-blah, right?\nMy max, my goal here,\ndespite the live blogging\nthat seems to happening,\nis to not make any news.\nIf you have a question that\nseems it might make news,\nplease, don't ask.\nI cannot answer it.\nAll right.\nWhen you, we'll have a microphone.\nAnd then, please, introduce yourself,\nyour major, your year, and your question.\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Female In Audience"}]},{"type":"text","value":" Hi, I'm Zoe.\nI'm a third-year\nundergraduate

yourself,\nand you're really happy that you did?\nYeah, well, one, I mean,\nthere are two of them that are,\nI think, stand out as a couple of\nthe biggest inflection points.\nOne of them was\nwhen I,\nI had been at Oracle, and like I say,\nI largely landed at\nOracle because they would\nlet me, they'd take me on when\nI said I'm only gonna work\nfor you for six months, and\nthen I'm gonna leave and ski.\nThey met that bar.\nAnd yet, I found myself there,\nand because of the way things developed,\nthere were these opportunities where,\nthere was a time when\nvideo-on-demand started to be,\nand now, we all use it\nall the time, right,\nbut video-on-demand\nstarted to be a big thing.\nAnd it was interesting,\nit was new, and I'd done\na little grad work in that area, too.\nAnd there was a, an idea\nthat I could be part of\nthe project that was gonna\nbe the big thing at Oracle\nthat was taking off, it\nwas super well funded, etc.\nOr I could go fulfill my\ndream of working for NeXT.\nYou know, I interviewed at NeXT.\nThey said...\nOracle had been very good to me.\nAnd so, at NeXT, they said,\n\"Well, you're really overpaid.\"\nAnd, I said, \"Oh, that's a bummer.\"\nAnd so, there was this\npoint where it's like,\nand NeXT was largely a\nfailed/failing company, right?\nThey'd gotten out of\nthe hardware business,\nkinda no one was buying the software.\nAnd yet, Oracle was\ngonna go big in a space\nthat seemed so promising, and emerging.\nAnd yet, having talked to the two teams,\nmet the people, saw what\nthey were working about.\nThere was one that I just felt like\nI want to be part of that,\nI want to be with them.\nI feel like I could learn so much.\nAnd, for me, that, I mean,\nthat's been the best,\none of the best decisions,\ncertainly, in my entire career,\nto be among those people.\nI mean, little did we\nrealize then, that what\nwe were creating at NeXT in this, to run\nin this square foot box\nwas the foundation of what\na billion people were gonna\nhave in their pockets.\nBut, that's where it all went.\nAnd I think, maybe\nthere was an element of,\nof just what you sense about\nthe people and the work\nthat you can, you can't\narticulate it to yourself,\nbut you can feel it, and\nthat's part of the attraction.\nAnd that was, that was there for me.\nAnd the other one was the decision\nto come back to grad school.\nI'd had it in my mind\nthat I wanted to do it.\nI'd had that I wanted\nto learn something more.\nI had been in the\nindustry a little bit and,\nyou know, course of saying stay, stay.\nYou know, here's a great opportunity\nfor you to do more here.\nAnd I said, you know, I\nmean, this one's horrible,\nby the way, they said, \"What\nwould it take for you to stay?\"\nAnd I made the most outland, the thing,\nlike you make the most\noutlandish set of demands, right?\nI won't even state them,\nbecause they're so ridiculous.\nI'm like, well, I could do this, and this,\nand give me a cut of the profits,\nand let me work here, and whatever.\nAnd I'm like, then we're gonna do this.\nAnd then they came back and said, \"Okay.\"\nWow!\nAnd so, (chuckles) so\nI said, \"But, I wanted\n\"to go to grad school.\"\nAnd the horrible part is,\nso, I said, \"God, well,\n\"okay!\"\nSo I said yes.\nAnd then Monday, school had started,\ngrad school had started,\nand I didn't show up,\nbecause I had said okay to this job.\nI'm sitting there back in my cubical.\nAnd I'm like, I do not want to be here.\nI want to go to grad school.\nAnd I called up the thing,\nI said, \"Can I still come?\n\"I've missed a few days of classes.\"\nAnd they said, \"Sure, come\non up, just start taking\n\"your classes again.\"\nAnd I went to grad school.\nIt was just this feeling\nof where I wanted to be.\nAnd I think, again, I feel like it was,\nit was the path intellectually and\nthat I wanted to take, and I was willing\nto listen to that and follow it, and,\nyou know, no complaints.\nWonderful.\nThere, in

to work, and stuff?\nYeah, okay, a bunch there.\nIn terms of sort of what's\nmy, what's my favorite thing,\nyou know, I got started when,\nreally, the way, well,\nthe way we programmed,\nthe languages, the frameworks,\nthe sort of idioms we used\nhave been really evolving\nover the years.\nEarly on, I always felt\nlike I love programming.\nAnd yet, I felt like so\nmuch of what we were doing\nwhen programming\nwas so tedious, you know.\nI think many of us are\ninherently lazy people,\nwe're always looking for\nhow can I make this easier?\nAnd then you do way more work\ntrying to make it easier,\nthan if you just went and did it, right?\nSo I've always been drawn to,\nto languages, frameworks, tools,\nthings that change the way\nsoftware is developed,\nto try to get to the root\nof how do I make something\nmaximally expressive and dynamic?\nAnd so, I love doing this kind of,\nthis kind development framework work.\nAt the same time, I've really come\nto love interaction design.\nWhen you can think about\nhow you are gonna connect\na piece of work to a customer experience,\nI'm not a good, I'm not a\ngood graphic designer, at all.\nI mean, horrendous.\nBut I can, I enjoy working with them.\nAnd I enjoy thinking about\nthat connection between\na customer experience\nwe want to create and\nwhat that experience can be, and then,\nwhat's the underlying architecture\nthat could make all of that happen?\nThere's something just\nfantastic about that.\nBut, I'll say, generally,\nalso with programming,\nthere's something really Zen about it.\nI mean, you can lose yourself for hours in\njust thinking deeply about a problem.\nAnd then, when it all comes together,\nthere's just this unbelievable feeling of,\nof I did it, it works, it\njust undeniably works, right?\nThere are lots of things\nwhere you could have opinions,\nor write an essay, and\nlike did you nail it?\nI don't know, but...\nBut you wrote a program\nand it did the thing,\nlike, there's no denying that it worked!\nAnd so, I get, I just get\nawesome satisfaction out of that.\nAnd I still do, and that's\nwhy I took a couple years\nwhere I wanted to return back from,\nfrom being in a little\nbit more nebulous world\nof high-level leadership, and into a role\nwhere I'm just sitting down for a day and,\nat the end of the day,\nI've solved a problem\nin the most concrete way possible.\nAnd I just, it felt so good.\nIn terms of burnout,\nI think it helps to have a\ndiversity of things that you're,\nthat you're working on.\nIf there are parts of your day where,\nor parts of your week where\nI'm gonna focus on this,\nand I'm gonna go deep,\nand sometimes there's,\nthere's a certain\nactivation energy to emerge,\nto immersing yourself\nsufficiently to get in\nthat productive zone, and\nreally crank some stuff out.\nAnd so, you gotta, you\ngotta be willing to go deep\nand spend that time.\nBut, then, to be able to spend some time\ndoing some other activities,\nit can still be related\nto your project, to programming,\nor something else in\nyour life that exercises\na different part of your\nbrain, and provides you\nwith different inspiration, or involves,\nnow I'm working with\npeople in a different way.\nMixing it up is great.\nAnd I'll say, you know, for me, in my job,\nit's awesome, because,\nI love almost every element of,\nof computer science,\nof the computing\nin hardware, and silica, and all this.\nAnd so, getting to work at\na scale where you're working\nwith the best people in\nall of these disciplines,\nand being able to touch\nthem all, and having\nthat constant diversity\nof problems you're solving\ndoes kind of keep renewing you, you know.\nYou're always, you're always\nlearning something new.\nI think that's always\nbeen part of how I've,\nwhat's drawn me into programming,\nis I'd learn something.\nI'd think of some, how do I\napply this thing I've learned?\nI'd come up with a\nproject I want to build.\nAnd then, you're building\nthe project and you realize\nthere's something else\nthat you need to learn\nto do it right.\nAnd there's nothing like\nhaving a problem to solve,\nand having that, seeking a solution,\nto then give you the hunger\nto learn, and the appreciation\nfor the solution when you're doing it.\nAnd that, that cycle\nis just so motivating.\nAnd with computers it's so great, because,\nyou can try that stuff out.\nAnd it's not like you're\ngonna build a bridge\nand kill people.\nRight, you can go experiment,\nand play, and yet, constantly be learning.\nI guess that
